# mono

[Mono](https://gperilli.github.io/mono/index.html) is an SVG based visual dictionary in Italian, Japanese, and English. It is designed to be an extremely simple, minimalist way of displaying semantic word groupings with links to external dictionaries, example sentences and audio examples. It was my intention to make Mono as simple and portable as possible, so that I could amass a large enough collection of data to make it useful to someone. With more support and/or time I will add languages and more features to the project. The important thing for language learners is that the vocabulary they learn is somehow meaningful, and structured in a useful way. There is an abundance of translation technology these days which is useful, of course, but does not support longer term learning goals. Similarly there is a plethora of flashcard software, but this places the burden on students to curate their own learning material which may or may not be well adapted to flashcard style memorization or practice. Mono, then, is an attempt to address vocabulary learning in a way that is useful, accessible, and free.

# Current Development

I'll be developing a js file which will insert one of Mono's annotated image blocks into a specified div in the near future. This is intended to allow easy implementation of mono's vocabulary sets on any site.
